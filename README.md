# nn

Forward feeding and back propagation exploration coded without the use of any machine learning libraries. Takes the equation of a circle from the command line (ex. "x^2 + y^2 >= 1.21"), generates a training set with points in and around the circle and whether they satisfy the given equation, and builds a neural network trained from these points. Testing error of ~1% with 4 layers and a maximum of 200k epochs.
